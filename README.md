# Horizons++
This project is a way for me to document my trips and travels, thus named because I'll be expanding my horizons (yes, yes -- I know it's bad, but it should also no surprise if you know me at all).

#### For the curious

Horizons++ is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and utilizes [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/); it began as a fork of [prose's Starter](https://github.com/prose/starter), a starting point for managing such a static site with [prose](http://prose.io). It's also using the "Forty" layout from [HTML5 Up](https://html5up.net/).

#### Note(s) to self

To work on the site locally, run `jekyll serve --watch`, then visit `http://localhost:4000/horizons/` in the browser.
