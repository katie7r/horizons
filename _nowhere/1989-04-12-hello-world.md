<p>
  I've been standing at the edge of the water
  Long as I can remember
  Never really knowing why
  I wish I could be the perfect daughter
  But I come back to the water
  No matter how hard I try
</p>

<p>
  Every turn I take
  Every trail I track
  Every path I make
  Every road leads back to the place I know
  Where I cannot go
  Where I long to be
</p>

<p>
  See the light where the sky meets the sea
  It calls me
  No one knows how far it goes
  If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
  One day I'll know
  If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go
</p>

<p>
  I know everybody on this island
  Seems so happy on this island
  Everything is by design
  I know everybody on this island
  Has a role on this island
  So maybe I could roll with mine
</p>

<p>
  I can lead with pride
  I can make us strong
  I'll be satisfied if I play along
  But the voice inside sings a different song
  What is wrong with me
</p>

<p>
  See the light as it shines on the sea
  It's blinding
  But no one knows how deep it goes
  And it seems like it's calling out to me
  So come find me
  And let me know
  What's beyond that line
  Will I cross that line
</p>

<p>
  See the light where the sky meets the sea
  It calls me
  And no one knows how far it goes
  If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
  One day I'll know
  How far I'll go
</p>
