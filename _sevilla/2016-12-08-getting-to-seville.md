We left the Tallahassee airport Thursday evening, flying to Miami, then Madrid, then Seville. Not a lot of note on that first flight, besides that Tony nearly finished his book and I talked to the guy I was sitting next to for a while (he was very nice). <!-- He gave his seat with "C, Charlie", and I joked that it would be a wonderful coincidence if his name were Charlie (it wasn't). We talked about me and Tony going to Seville, and we talked about the job he'd been offered at FAMU and the one he'd rather have and was interviewing for in D.C. after a day at home in Miami. When we got to Miami, he told us some places we should check out if we come back to Miami for any time, and I wished him luck at his interview. -->

The flight from Miami to Madrid was quite a bit longer and more eventful. <!--When we boarded, I failed my first test of Spanish when the guy who checked my boarding pass wished me a good trip; I just stared at him dumbly and may have said, "Huh?" before he repeated it in English. Whoops. --> The plane (we flew with Iberia - 10/10, would fly with again) was really nice. The seats were (for airplane seats, at least) pretty comfortable, with an entertainment system built into the backs of the seats in front. You could plug in your headphones (they handed out free ones, too) and watch from a decent selection of movies and TV shows, or you could play various games or check flight details. I played some sudoku for a bit and ended up watching The Secret Life of Pets while Tony finished his book. Tony tried to sleep for a while. I had some issues later in the flight (maybe from poor circulation? ...but it was also fairly turbulent for a stretch) where I was super nauseous and also I briefly fainted (whoops<!--  again -->). Shortly afterwards, they came around with complementary breakfast, which was surprisingly good: a turkey/cheddar sandwich on a croissant, a blueberry muffin (I talked Tony into giving me his, too), and some fruit gummies. All in all, it was a fine flight full of excitement and adventure.

We arrived in Madrid on December 9, around 7am in our time, 1pm in whatever timezone Madrid is in. We had a five hour layover before catching our quick flight to Seville, so we hung out in the airport. The airport itself was pretty interesting; they had a lot of brightly-colored seating areas and the supports running down long stretches would gradually progress through shades of the rainbow. Most of my time there was spent dozing against Tony's shoulder, while he spent his time alternating between work and napping. Before we left, Tony got a sandwich out of a vending machine; it was, I think, the first vending machine sandwich I have tried, and I teased Tony for getting the American sandwich like a typical American even though we were in Spain. We both slept pretty much from boarding to disembarking the flight to Seville.

Once in Seville, we collected our bags, cleared customs, and followed the crowd of people queueing up for a taxi. Our taxi driver did not speak any English, we discovered, and we had some difficulty communicating where we wanted to go because he did not know the street itself, nor the Bascillica that is nearby. At one point, he asked me to write out the directions on a paper pad for him, but the map was winding and I ran out of space. Tony was trying to pull things up in a translator app, and just every time the driver would say something to us in Spanish and realize we couldn't understand anything he'd said, he would sigh heavily. 
Eventually Tony was able to get a map that the driver could use, and we got where we were going. He didn't take credit cards though, and I thought he said "seventy" something (instead of "veinte," which is what he really said), so I said I'd need an ATM since I had some Euros but not enough. He looked frustrated and disappointed, but I pulled out what I did have, and we worked it out since he didn't actually need &euro;70 (although, with trying to make the right change, we still ended up overpaying him; I felt stupid about it afterwards, especially when I realized we could have just written the numbers down to figure it out between the languages, but it was a good learning experience).

We crossed over to the road he pointed us to where our AirBnB was. We were staying in unit 58, but we couldn't find anything with "58" on it; we saw 54, 56, 57, and 59, so we figured it was the right-ish place, but we wandered up and down the street for a bit to check. We eventually called our host, who directed us to where the lockbox for the keys were and told us the apartment was to the left of where the keys were. Then, we had trouble getting the door to open with said keys, so she just biked over to help. The door was, in fact, to the right of the keys, but finally we were in. By then, it was about 9pm local time and about 22 hours since we left our house. We were pooped, so we basically just showered and went straight to bed.
