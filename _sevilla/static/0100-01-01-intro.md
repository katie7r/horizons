- Why
- Nice guy on first plane
- Nice plane on second plane
- Failed first Spanish test (good trip wishes)
- Did not so fail second Spanish test (~ o pollo, said neither)
- Almost threw up, did faint on second plane
- Madrid airport is cool
- Napping (aka passing out) in airport
- My first vending machine sandwich (Tony got the American sandwich)
- Slept pretty much all between boarding and departing third plane
- Seville airport we just went and got in a taxi
- Taxi driver did not speak English and Tony does not speak Spanish
- We got him lost and finally figured out how new maps app works enough to get where we needed
- Didn't take cards, thought he said $70-something (vente something really, I realized, which is what I had expected but also we were awful and unhelpful so meh), overpaid because I didnt think to just write down the damn numbers
- Got to the AirBnB but couldnt find he number
- Finally, called and were able to get the key but then couldn't get the door open, so called her again
- She came and we found we were at the wrong door, so finally got in!
- Found that one of front windows is actually just bars, shutters, and air... otherwise wuite happy with it!
