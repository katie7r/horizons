Our first night, Tony (and so I, too) woke up at 3am, so he could finalize his slides for the conference. He got up at 7am to actually leave, and that was rough for both of us.

I basically just slept fitfully until he returned around 1pm, with Jon and Megan in tow.

- Went for lunch in that little plaza area
- Good lunch (brohceta de pollo? & pollo pinccito?) at one of the little resturaunts in the plaza (really good)
- Chucho/Chuncho the performer who drummed and did handstands and acrobatics and was pretty cool
- J&M gave us the skinny on some stuff (like a market, a flamenco dinner, etc.)
- Came back and rested for a bit, did some work
- Walked to market (nice lady behind us in line who helped with the "Plastic" question)
- Came back and tried to figure out the heater but gave up

- Next: going out for dinner on our own
