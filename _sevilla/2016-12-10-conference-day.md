Our first night, Tony (and so I, too) woke up at 3am, so he could finalize his slides for the conference. He got up at 7am to actually leave, and that was pretty rough for him. He said that his presentation could have gone better, and people kept wanting to go over their time in the session he chaired. I basically just tried to keep sleeping until he returned, with Jon and Megan in tow.

We all four went for lunch in la [Alameda de Hércules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Alameda,_Seville), a pleasant plaza/mall (mall like D.C., not like Governor's Square). We ate at one of the little restaurants there outside; Tony and I got chicken tapas (both kebabs; mine with veggies and couscous <!-- ~ brocheta de pollo? --> and his with potatoes <!-- ~ pollo pinccito? -->) that were really good. A performer named Chucho (or something close to it) did some cool drumming stuff, plus some handstands and acrobatics, while a crowd of children gathered around to watch. Jon and Megan gave us some tips on things to do or places to go (a nearby market for food, a flamenco show with dinner, etc.), and we hung out for a bit. On the way back to our room, I turned us down the wrong branch of a fork so we wandered down some new streets for a few minutes.

When we got back, we rested and worked for a bit before heading over to the market for some snacks and backup food. We got some chips that we hope they have in the US (Lays with olive oil) and some sort of delicious looking chocolate pudding cake things (also some apples and grapes and such). When we were checking out, the cashier asked us, "Bolsa?" and we just looked at each other, confused, until the lady in line behind us helped us out and we confirmed that we wanted to use the plastic bag. We tried to figure out the heater in our room when we got back, but eventually gave up and worked some more.

Around 10:30p (because they eat later here, which suits me just fine) we went to dinner on our own at [Dúo Tapas](https://www.facebook.com/DuoTapasSevilla/), also at La Alameda. As Tony put it, I "buckled under pressure immediately" when she started talking to us, but she tried a little bit of English that made it less stressful to try a little bit of Spanish. We waited outside for a few minutes, and there was some live music happening across the street and at least one person dancing around as they walked. Apparently there was some sort of holiday or festival happening, so many people were out and in high spirits.

We sat inside, and it was super loud, and at several points various tables started clapping in time in some sort of rhythm or ritual I didn't understand, but it was all fun. I responded to her question about what we wanted to drink (in Spanish!) with "agua y vino... canasta" (also in Spanish!). I got the Canasta from the Vino Dulce list; I assume that means "sweet wine" and I assume then that I don't like sweet wines - too syrupy (and Tony agreed). Tony got a beer that we both really liked (San Miguel: Clara). The glass that came with the beer broke when he took it down, so we had to ask for another one. <!-- I also held the beer for the waiter to remove the bottle cap when he came back (no language fumbling necessary! just good old fashioned reasoning). --> For food, we got tapas: Tony got the Pollo al Curry and I got the Croquettas. There were multiple types of croquetta, and although I had already decided on the mushroom filling from looking at the menu beforehand, it wasn't listed on the menu there and I didn't hear if "boletus" was an option when she said them (I remembered looking up "boletus" and it being a mushroom, but I forgot that generic "mushroom" is "seta")... so I found "boletus" elsewhere on the menu ("Risotto de Boletus") and pointed to it, but she thought I meant the risotto, so I said "croquettas con" and pointed and said "boletus" and she got it. Not the most exciting in the retelling, but I was pretty pleased with myself in the moment.

The food was good. The croquettas were not terribly filling (being tapas), but Tony's curry chicken was enough to fill him up on its own. I wanted dessert, but we had to wait a while before we could even flag the waitress down; by then we had seen the dessert menu on a neighboring table. I did my best to ask her for "Muertex Chocolate" (which the translator said was "undying chocolate," so I figured that was a solid choice; I would have asked what it was, but, as Tony pointed out, I wouldn't understand the explanation anyways). I pronounced the x as an x which I think was way wrong but she got it, and we got it, and it was pretty good too. 

The total check was under $20, which was awesome. The check itself came with two shots of something-limoncello-something which was very bright and fairly strong but very tasty. There was also some candy that I mistakenly told Tony was a mint, and which he then informed me was in fact _not_ a mint. Even though it was very loud, I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It was fun and laid back and tasty and quite enjoyable. We had a really good time, then headed home and went to bed soon after.
